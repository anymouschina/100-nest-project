## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)
- npm
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Getting Started

Follow these commands to install any dependency and setting up the Database.
Also filling some tables with dummy data.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LORDyyyyy/simple-orderManagementSystem
npm install
```

Next you need to change the Database connection URL in the [.env](./.env) file

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DB_NAME?schema=public"
```

You can leave everything the same as it is in the file except the `USERNAME` and the `PASSWORD`.

Also you can change the Database provider from PostgreSQL to any other DBMS.
See [Prisma Documentation - Data sources](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/data-sources).
Don't forget to change the provider name in [prisma/schema.prisma](./prisma/schema.prisma).

---

Building the application and the Database:

```bash
npm run db:init
npm run build
npm run db:seed
```

Running the application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Or in one step:

```bash
npm run start:all
```

Be careful from running this command multiple times, you will add the dummy data more than once.

## API Documentation

API endpoints are documented using Swagger. Once the server is running locally, access the documentation at:

```bash
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

## Additional Features

Here are the additional features that has been added to the application:

- Order History Retrieval for a specific users
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/users/:userId/orders`
- Applying Discounts and Coupons to orders
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/orders/apply-coupon`\

## Dummy Data

Here are the dummy data that has been added to the tables `User`, `Product`, and `Coupons`.

## Postman Collection

A Postman collection is included to facilitate API testing.
To use it:

- Import the [OMS.postman_collection.json](./OMS.postman_collection.json) file into Postman.
- Ensure your local server is running.
- Execute the API requests defined in the collection to test the endpoints.
